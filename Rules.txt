## How to Play

### Game Rules
1. The game consists of 9 small Tic-Tac-Toe boards arranged in a 3×3 large board.
2. Winning a small board follows normal Tic-Tac-Toe rules (3 in a row).
3. To win the game, you must win 3 small boards in a row on the large board.
4. The cell you play determines which small board your opponent must play in next.
5. If that board is already full or won, your opponent may choose any available board.

### Strategy Tips
- Focus on both winning small boards and controlling where your opponent can play.
- Try to send your opponent to boards you've already won or that are disadvantageous for them.
- Think ahead - consider not just your immediate move but also where it will force your opponent to play next.

## AI Implementation

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning:
- **Easy**: Depth 1 search with random elements
- **Medium**: Depth 3 search with evaluation function
- **Hard**: Depth 5 search with Alpha-Beta pruning

The evaluation function considers:
- Small boards won
- Potential winning lines
- Center and corner control
- Strategic board positioning
